# Face-Detection
The scope of this project is Face Detection. Face detection is basically an image segmentation 
problem as the image is to be segmented into two parts: one containing faces and the other 
representing non-face regions. Face detection takes images as input and locates face areas 
within these images. This is done by separating face areas from non-face background regions. 
Facial feature extraction locates important feature (eyes, mouth, nose and eye-brows) positions 
within a detected face. The main goal of face detection is to determine whether or not there are 
any faces in the image and if present, return the location of any face or faces within that image 
and the extent of each face. The objective of this project is to develop a very efficient algorithm, 
in terms of low computational complexity, with the maximum number of face detections and 
the minimum number of false alarms.
